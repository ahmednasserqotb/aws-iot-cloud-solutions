# AWS Docs Scout â€“ Week 1

Use AWS docs to quickly answer:
- What is an **EC2 instance** and how do I size it?
- How to create an **S3 bucket** and set basic permissions?
- Where is the **AWS IoT Core** developer guide?
- Find a **Hello World** for **Lambda** (Python).

## Links I used
- EC2: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
- S3: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-buckets-s3.html
- IoT Core: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html
- Lambda (Python): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html
